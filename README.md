## 🌍 Vision

Government portals like **data.gov.in** provide valuable datasets across various ministries.  
However, these datasets often exist in different formats and structures, making it difficult to analyze them together.  
Project Samarth solves this challenge by offering an **AI-powered chatbot interface** that retrieves, processes, and explains data-driven insights.
